Today we are announcing our plans for the future of Ruby version 1.9.3.

Currently this branch is in maintenance mode, and will remain so until
February 23, 2014.

After February 23 2014, we will only provide security fixes for 1.9.3 until
February 23 2015, after which all support will end for 1.9.3.

We highly recommend that you upgrade to Ruby 2.1 or 2.0.0 as soon as possible.
